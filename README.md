# Turbidity as a Measure of River Health - Campbell


## Project Overview and Purpose

This project attempts to quantify the scale and change of water turbidity through September 23rd, 2024 – September 23rd, 2025, against the weighted historical average available in the Calgary Surface Water Quality Record for publication in the University of Calgary - State of Our City 2025 Atlas for Geography 587. Using simple overlay analysis and Inverse Distance Weighting Interpolation methods native to ArcGIS Pro to generate a layout estimating probable continuous turbidity values through generated, discrete, XY Sampling points; simple statistics summarization was utilized to generate a mean average site sample before these manipulated the file tables were joined and exported for Interpolation. This project should be referenced with extreme care, as it represents an undergraduate’s students first attempts at interpolation. Results should be validated against user error to ensure the conclusions are in fact dependable and with merit.

## Folder Structure Guide

### Central Repository: 
> This project repository contains the Usage Licence for this projects contents; Readme File with relevant project metadata and workflows; and Project Datasets & Masters to compile the project results.

### Data_Masters:
> This subfile contains all finished tables and shapefiles required to create the project layout and interpolation results as they were downloaded from the Calgary Open Data Portal.
### Data_Projects:
> This subfile contains the edited project files synthesised, cleaned, and organized from the master datasets to generate the project results. 



## CRS and Data Format Notes
> The Project Dataset are all projected in 3TM 114 projected coordinate system to reduce distortion for the Calgary area. The Master Datasets are natively hosted in WGS 1984 standard as per the Calgary Data Portal. 
- Vector and Table Data stored in Data_Project for this repository is saved in .shapfile zip folders as errors were encountered when packaging as .csv format. 
- The exported Raster files within the Project stored within the are stored as .tiff files for ease of use when importing from GitHub into ArcGIS Pro.


## Data Sources and Method Summary
>All Data was sourced from the Open Calgary Data Portal; summery statistics were tabulated using ArcGIS Pro's "Summery Statistics" function with simple mathematical equations generated by the author.
1. Data Cleaning - this is optional as the Data_Project Files have already been cleaned for use. If using Data_Masters the [Watershed_Surface_Water_Quality_Data_20251025.csv](https://github.com/KCGIS-92/Turbidity_as_a_Measure_of_River_Health---Campbell/blob/main/Data_Masters/Watershed_Surface_Water_Quality_Data_20251025.csv "Watershed_Surface_Water_Quality_Data_20251025.csv") file must be filtered for only Turbidity (TSS) parameters and this filtered data copied into a yearly and historic sheet respectively. The yearly sheet must also be filtered for samples between September 23rd 2024 and September 23rd 2025.

	- Set Working Map in ArcGIS to 3TM 114 (v7) to ensure all layers are in the correct Projected Coordinate System.
	- Once separated these sheets can be imported into the Arc GIS Pro using Excel to Table Tool with the Esri Software. 
	- Create three additional fields in the table view for this new file and name them **Mean_Weighted**; **Site_Weight:**; and **Mean_Numeric_Result:**. See **Field Dictionary** for details on their input formulas. This is done by using the calculate fields function, and Summerize Statistics function.
	- Once all three fields are generated in their subsequent tables, use the Join function to combine all tables with the Geographic Coordinates field, using Sample_Site as the Key.
	- Export this new file to geodatabase to make joins permanent. 
	- Use the XY to Point Tool on new Exported file to geolocate Samples as Point values. Use this new feature layer as the basis for all further Interpolation.
	- Using the Community_District_Boundaries and creating a simple Background Polygon square; use the erase tool to remove features that overlay the Hydrology layer for both above files as not to cover the interpolation results. 
	- Layer all above files in meaningful order in the contents pane; you are now prepared to interpolated the new Sample_Sites point layer. 
	
2. If using the Data_Project files simply import all shapefiles into Arc Pro geodatabase and bring them into your working map. Layers them in order that makes the most sense for viewing. 
3. Use the Geowizard Interpolation tool on XYStatistics_Tables_Project  or your geolocated Smaple points feature layer. Select Inverse Distance weighting; change the power to 1 as this provided the lowest root mean square error. Leave all other fields as default. 
4. This will generate the temporary interpolation layer. Repeat this for the yearly or historic layer (depending on your initial choice). once pleased with the accuracy, export this temporary layer as a raster to make it permanent. This is represented in the finished project file as Interpolation_Historic_Project and Interpolation_yearly_Project. Layer beneath the existing boundaries polygon and background.
5. The interpolation is now finished. Symbolize your Usage Boundaries layer by Code_class with relevant colour scheme. Repeat symbology for both Interpolation layers.
6. The data classification for these interpolations were done in Jenks Brigs due to non-gaussian distribution of data points, and skewed bimodal data. Layer the Historic value manual with these values as to standardize for comparison. Pick a relevant colour scheme for each. Label these values as --> Very Low - Low – Medium – High – Very High Turbidity for readability.
7. The layers can now be copied to different maps at the 1:70 000 extent scale for the Glenbow, Elbow and Bow River subsections. 
8. Develop layout as needed.



## Field Dictionary 

#### Community_Boundary_LanduseClassCodes_Project.zip
>The only relevant field of this File is ***class_code*** denoting the classification of land use for each Community Polygon. Used for overlay analysis to see if certain turbidity spikes are associated with land usage.
#### XYStatistics_Tables_Project.zip
>This file contains both the **TSS_Year_Totals_Point** and **TSS_Historic_Totals_Point.** These attributes apply additionally to the **Watershed_Surface_Water_Quality_Data_20251025.csv**
- **Sample Site:** Represents a single testing location for water parameters for the City of Calgary. Site Key serves as a secondary search key. 
- **Latitude:** Spatial identifier - Y coordinate for use with the XY to Point tool
- **Longitude:** Spatial identifier - x coordinate for use with the XY to Point tool
- **Frequency:** the number of testing results per Sample Site.
- **Parameter:** What water quality parameter is being tested
- **Mean_Numeric_Result:** Represents the average result of the parameter within a given interval of time using the Summerize Statistics Function.
- **Site_Weight:** Represents the weight attributed to each site based upon each sites Frequency / Total Samples
- **Mean_Weighted**: The weighted average for each site calculated with the equation (Mean_Numeric_Result * Site_Weight). This is only required for Kriging, as IDW will generate this for you based on previous 2 fields above.
- **Result Units:** the unit of measurement attributed to each Parameter.
